### Diabetes Prediction Model
- This Machine Learning model is developed to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on the certain features like Blood Pressure, Insulin, Glucose, BMI, Age etc.
This model is based on the Stacking Algorithm Classification Technique in which Adaboost and Random Forest techniques were used as base estimators and Decision Tree Algorithm was 
used as a final estimator. Also the upsampling technique was implemented to balance the datased before training model based on the Stacking Algorithm.
- The model performance is also presented via Classification Report, Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC Score and their interpretations.
